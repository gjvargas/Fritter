Fritter

I built this project for one of my classes at MIT. It is
a Twitter clone called 'Fritter'. Although it is not as 
pretty, this web site supports much of the functionality
offered by twitter. It allows users to make/edit/delete
posts. Users can also follow other users, which will 
affect their news feed. Basic search functionality is
also supported. This project taught me to think about
how different aspects of social media sites are built
and designed.

To run fritter on your own machine:

    - Clone this repository
    - Go to project in your terminal
    - Type 'npm install' to install dependencies
    - Type 'npm start' to start local server
    - Go to 'localhost:3000' in your web browser

Note that this project was built with Node.js which you 
need to have installed to run the program.
